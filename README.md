# German Rubber Ducky encoder
German HTML/JS based encoder for Rubber Ducky.

I took the HTML file found at https://forums.hak5.org/topic/43834-release-html-duck-encoder/ and replaced the built-in US keyboard encoding with the German keyboard encoding found at https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads/tree/master/languages

I couldn't find a license, hope that this is OK for the original author.
